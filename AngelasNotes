# define params:

threshold = 0.4	  #range of 0-1. Represents the boundary for setting a binary congested/
			#	not congested variable


tcells = 1	  #number of cells away in the time axis that can still be a connection
		#should only help ID bottlenecks if a sensor is accurate only sometimes
		#ex: if power is lost for X time units, this could help us ID a bottleneck that 
		# 	includes the section of lost data


xcells = 1  	#number of cells away in the position axis that can still be a connection
		#if a sensor is faulty, it may not report congestion, but the sensors before and after
		#may still report correct data.
		#should be used in conjunction with a variable to represent distance between two
		#   cell, in real distance


predist = 0	  #is set to equal the distance between the currently checked station and the 
    #	  previous station


postdist = 0	#is set to equal the distance between the currently checked station and the
		#	  previous station

Bottleneck at a single position: check that position for multiple time units showing congestion. Record the start/stop 
time of the congestion. Potentially check for boundary+tcells in case sensor malfunction reports incorrectly, or if 
threshold value is right on the edge of congestion level


Bottleneck causing backed-up traffic: in this case, we would see several cells in a row in the x direction with congestion. 
Likely all at same t, but could show a congestion wave with later t for downstream x. Probably a mix of both.


Weighting cells by connectedness: What kind of meaningful data might we get by coloring/shading a cell based solely on its 
connectedness? As we iterate through the array of binary values that tell if a cell is congested or not, we can increment its 
connectedness to other cells in the t and x direction by checking if its neighboring cells (definitely immediate neighbors, 
probably diagonals as well, and ideally extend to neighbors of these) are also congested. Cells with the highest values of 
connectedness should indicate locations/times with the longest queues. If we want show show both x and t connectedness for a
cell, perhaps we can use color and intensity/brightness. Seeing an array of connectedness data may make a recipe for vizualization
more intuitive.
